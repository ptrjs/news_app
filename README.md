# news_app

I made a news app made by Flutter.
<br>
The design is inspired from dribbble https://dribbble.com/shots/20776712-GoRead-News-App
<br>
The Author of the design https://dribbble.com/rzlartnto
<br>
The API for news content at this app is from https://newsapi.org/
<br>
The purpose of making this app is to learn Flutter, consume API, and add it to my portfolio.
